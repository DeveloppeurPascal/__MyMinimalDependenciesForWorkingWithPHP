# Minimal dependencies install for working with PHP on my projects

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project is used to initialize my working environment for building websites, backoffices or API servers.

When you launch the batch file, you'll repatriate a number of code repositories to the folder in which you'll run it. Ideally, you should do this in the folder of your local web server.

You can use this basic project for your own installations by making a fork or copy and then customizing it to suit your needs, or simply taking inspiration from how it works.

If you're working on software, mobile applications and video games in Pascal (under Delphi or not) you could also use my [other minimal installation code repository for Delphi web projects](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.
